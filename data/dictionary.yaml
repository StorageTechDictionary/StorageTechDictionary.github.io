- term: Aligner
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    It aligns items within a block to ensure some sort of behavior. More basic
    concepts involve simply letting items in a water or ice stream hit against a
    block with a certain hitbox, while more complex ones involve precisely timed
    contraptions, see @[Perfect aligner]. The more simple use cases involve using
    a chest, dragon egg, 2 or 3 stack of pickles, cake or some other block to
    align the items between two blocks such that they go over some hoppers and
    are inside a water stream at the same time. The use of different hitboxes
    allows for some more complex behaviour, where items can cycle exactly twice
    in a loop and then exit, or you can send many channels along one water line
    and have each channel exit in a different spot of the stream.

- term: Batcher
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A Batcher groups item entities together before periodically releasing them
    into a waterstream or iceline. This is done to improve lag and because some
    filters ( Especially 2x filters ) would be on cooldown much less often and
    therefore miss less or no items.

- term: Binary
  aka:
    - bin
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    An encoding where each digit of a code is either on or off (we say it has a
    binary state, usually represented with 0s and 1s). A four digit (@[Bit])
    signal could have the states 0000 or 0110 or 0100, or any other combination
    of the valid states. In terms of minecraft, this usually translates to a
    wire or a rail being on or off, a piston being extended or retracted, a note
    block being powered or unpowered, etc.

- term: Bit
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: 'Short for binary digit: the digits in a @[binary] system.'

- term: Block event delay
  aka:
    - BED
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    Block event delay usually refers to piston updating other pistons in a
    chain reaction within a single game tick. Since pistons activate during the
    block event phase of the tick (kind of) and things execute in the order
    they are scheduled, having something be activated by a piston that was
    updated by a chain of three other pistons before it (BED 3) will always
    happen before something that was activated by a BED 5 event.

- term: Block Update Detector
  aka:
    - BUD
  tags:
    - Contraption
  description: >-
    A Block Update detector is a device that has something happen when it
    receives an update. Example: A piston that is @[Quasi-powered](Quasi
    connectivity) but not yet updated is called "BUDded", and will fire when
    updated. This term is sometimes used to refer to a component that is being
    QC powered by saying it's "BUD powered".

- term: Box Comparer
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A Box Comparer is a contraption that takes two boxes as input, and compares
    them by signal strength. A Box comparer normally has dedicated outputs for
    the fuller and less full boxes.

    Box comparers are used in many contraptions, one example is making sure that
    @[Mergers](Merger) get the fuller box in the correct input. 

- term: Box Detection
  tags:
    - Feature
    - StorageTech Concept
  description: >-
    Usually used as a way to tag @[Loaders](Loader) and @[Box Displays](Box
    Display) that restart themselves when boxes come in and they were previously
    empty.

- term: Box Display
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A contraption that displays a shulker box and has some or all of the
    following features:

    a button to dispense a new box, breaking of the box when it empties,
    automatically dispensing a new box when the old one is broken, storage for
    new shulker boxes, access to said storage, and some others, like hopper
    locking and not hiding boxes from the player in inaccessible inventories
    (called no buffer).

- term: Box Separator
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A Box Separator is a contraption that takes boxes as input and separates
    them into different outputs based on their contents. This could for example
    be a contraption that takes single item-type boxes and has different outputs
    for boxes with 16-stackables and 64-stackables 

- term: Box Sorter
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A Box Sorter is a contraption that takes in boxes of a single item-type,
    takes the first item out and assigns the box to a storage @[Slice] that
    matches the filter of that item. 

- term: Bulk Storage
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    At it's simplest, a bulk storage is just a system that stores a lot of
    items, usually a single type per module and in box form. The challenge
    usually comes in trying to make the system compact, extremely lag friendly
    (through @[Hopper-locked] storage and other techniques), and adding features
    like @[Item Call] and @[Encoded] storage.

- term: Chest Hall
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A hall containing chests for items. It usually come in @[slices](slice) so
    that it can be stacked and extended as large as needed. They differ widely
    in functionality and amount of items available in each slice. Both encoded
    chest halls and fixed item sorter based chest halls exists. These are
    usually the main @[UI] elements of a storage system.

- term: Comparator Update Detector
  aka:
    - CUD
  tags:
    - Contraption
  description: >-
    A Comparator Update Detector is based on the behavior inherent to
    comparators where they don't notice inventory changes when reading it
    through a solid block (including an inventory being moved away or put in
    place, like a composter being moved by a piston). The CUD will then change
    it's signal once it either receives a block or inventory update.

- term: Crosstalk
  tags:
    - Bad Practice
    - StorageTech Concept
  description: >-
    A term used for when 2 tiled @[Slices](slice) are interfering with each other
    in any situation. 

- term: Decoder
  tags:
    - Contraption
  description: >-
    A Decoder has two main meanings in storage tech: A contraption that
    translates code or data to item, like an encoded storage hall, the inverse
    of an @[Encoder], or one that translates code into user-readable
    information, like a display. In addition, in computational redstone it's
    sometimes used to mean increasing the size of a base, bin to hex, for
    example, see @[Transcoder].

- term: Directional
  tags:
    - Bad Practice
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A contraption is said to be directional if it exhibits a different behavior
    when rotated or mirrored.  This is usually caused by some internal component
    being directional itself, which in turn is most often caused by update
    order: each components notifies its neighbors of the update in a set order
    (for example, negative to positive z first, then negative to positive y,
    then x). There are also other causes of directionality. 

- term: Dropper speed
  aka:
    - HS
    - '1x, 2x, 1/2x, ...'
  tags:
    - Feature
  description: >-
    Similar to @[Hopper speed], but less frequently used. Refers to the speed at
    which items are processed in a dropper when clocked at the minimum interval
    (1 item every 4@[gt](gametick)). Usually written as an integer or fraction
    (e.g. "3x or 1/2x dropper speed"). 1x Dropper speed is equal to 2x @[Hopper
    speed].

- term: Dropperline
  tags:
    - Contraption
  description: A line of droppers to transport items fast.

- term: Dust updateless
  tags:
    - Feature
    - Good Practice
    - Concept
  description: >-
    Some contraptions are not @[Dustless], but the dust they use does not get
    updated (does not change @[ss](Signal Strength)). This can be because it is
    either used to steadily power a component, or because it's used by
    redirecting it, but not changing ss. Redirecting dust is really lag
    friendly, as lag usage goes. These terms are therefore often used
    interchangeably.

- term: Dustless
  tags:
    - Feature
    - Good Practice
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A contraption that makes no use of redstone dust. Redstone dust is one of
    the single most laggiest components in the game, since it gives 25 updates
    for each @[ss](Signal Strength) change. When increasing signal, it updates
    one for each increase level, so going from ss 3 to 7, for instance would
    give 100 block updates. Decreasing signal is different between versions
    1.14- and 1.15+, where in the former it happens the same way it does when
    increasing values, and in the latter, it moves by steps of two, reducing the
    amount of updates by half. In 1.15+ dust dots (single dust) update all at
    once, without stepping through intermediary ss values. A big part of the
    community also calls @[Dust updateless] contraptions Dustless, since the
    updates is the only part of the dust that lags.

- term: Encoded
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A system is said to be encoded when a signal in the form of a code is used
    to decide the fate of items or boxes. In broader terms, it refers to
    systems that use codes to transfer instructions. Codes can be a @[Binary]
    signal, a @[Hexadecimal] signal or, less often, octal or quaternary, with
    either multiple or single digits.

- term: Encoder
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    An Encoder has two main meanings in storage tech: A contraption that
    translates items into a code, where code can be any sort of signal in any
    base (bin, hex, other less used ones) or other codes (block event delay),
    or a contraption that translates a player input (say a selection panel)
    into code. In addition, in computational redstone, this sometimes refers to
    decreasing the size of the base used in the code: for example hex to bin.
    see @[Transcoder].

- term: Fill Sorter
  aka:
    - IsEmpty
    - IsFull
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A Fill Sorter is a @[Box Separator] that has different outputs based on how
    full the box is, usually Empty / Full / Partial.

    IsEmpty is a Fill Sorter that only has outputs for empty and not-empty (
    Full / Partial )

    IsFull is a Fill Sorter that only has outputs for full and not-full ( Empty
    / Partial )

- term: Filtered Loader
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A @[Loader] combined with an item filter that fills a box with just one item
    type.

- term: Fixed Sorter
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    Short for fixed type item sorter: a sorter that filters out one single item
    type and can't be changed without manual intervention. 

- term: FPS
  aka:
    - Frames Per Second
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A measure of how many frames a client is able to process each second.
    This is similar to, but independent of @[TPS], which denotes server-side
    performance.

- term: Gametick
  aka:
    - gt
    - tick
    - t
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    Minecraft iteratively runs its processing code in a loop. One cycle of this
    loop is called a Tick or Gametick (gt). 

    Gameticks are also used as the default measurement of time while working
    with redstone. The game attempts to run 20 gameticks a second (20tps), but
    will fail to do so and slow down the game if the server is lagging
    (>50mspt). 

    Often confused with the less technical term "redstone tick". A redstone tick
    is in practice 2gt, as its origin comes from the default setting of a
    repeater. 

    A default repeater when freshly placed is a 2gt- or one
    redstone-tick-repeater.

- term: Global Output
  tags:
    - Feature
    - StorageTech Concept
  description: >-
    A contraption, usually a @[1-wide tileable](n-Wide Tileable) one, that has
    only one output for all the @[Slices](Slice), in contrast to one output per
    slice (see @[Slice Preservation]).

- term: Global/Local
  tags:
    - StorageTech Concept
  description: >-
    Annotates if a signal comes from a global system ( a "brain" ), or from
    within a @[Slice].

    For example, one global clock could send signals to 8 slices on an interval,
    or all 8 slices could have their own clock.

- term: Hexadecimal
  aka:
    - Hex
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A code where each digit of the code has 16 possible states (usually
    represented as 0 to 9 and then A to F). It's most commonly implemented with
    signal strength values, where @[ss](Signal Strength) 0 represents 0, ss10
    represents A, ss15 represents F and so on. Multiple hex signals can be
    combined to form a code with multiple digits. For example, valid three digit
    hex codes are 032, AFF, 0F4. 

- term: Hopper speed
  aka:
    - HS
    - '1x, 2x, 1/2x, ...'
  tags:
    - Feature
    - StorageTech Concept
  description: >-
    Refers to the speed at which items are processed in a hopper (1 item every
    8@[gt](gametick)). Often used as a way of quantifying speed of a system in
    terms of how many hoppers worth of items are processed in or out. Usually
    written as an integer or fraction (e.g. "3x or 1/2x hopper speed"). See
    also: @[Dropper speed].

- term: Hopper-locked
  tags:
    - Feature
    - Good Practice
    - StorageTech Concept
  description: >-
    Used to tag contraptions that lock their hoppers when the hoppers are not
    needed. This is because hoppers are otherwise very laggy.

- term: Item Call
  tags:
    - Feature
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A device, mechanism or feature that allows the user to request items. The
    requested items may land in a user accessible inventory or be used to
    restock some component. Some systems can also use item call to automatically
    restock, for example from @[Bulk Storage].

- term: Keygen
  aka:
    - Item Wanker
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    Usually part of a @[Box Sorter], a keygen is a contraption that takes one
    item out of a box, breaks it and sends the item and sends one through one
    hopper or @[Dropperline] and the other through another one, with some delay.

- term: Liquid Update Detector
  aka:
    - LUD
  tags:
    - Contraption
  description: >-
    A Liquid Update Detector (LUD) is a device that uses liquids to detect a
    special set of updates, some of which can be detected with a @[Block Update
    Detector], with a @[Comparator Update Detector] or with an observer, but
    some of which are exclusively detected by LUDs. After detecting the update
    and triggering, it usually resets the liquid to a state where it can detect
    an update again.

- term: Loader
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A contraption that fills a shulkerbox with items and then breaks the
    shulkerbox.

- term: Locational
  tags:
    - Bad Practice
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A contraption is said to be locational when it exhibits different behavior
    when built in different locations in the world. This is almost always caused
    by redstone dust updates themselves being locational: the way they notify
    their neighbors of their updates is not consistent across locations in the
    world.

- term: Merger
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A Merger is a contraption that takes 2 boxes as input, and merges them into
    one.

    Mergers can work of mixed boxes, however most mergers assume that both boxes
    only 

    contain one itemtype and are often used in conjunction with
    @[Splitters](Splitter).

- term: Mixed Box
  tags:
    - StorageTech Concept
  description: A shulker box with multiple item types.

- term: Mixed loader
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A @[Loader]  that can handle multiple itemtypes going to the same box.
    Fullness detection is usually done by reading that items are backing up in
    the container ( hopper / dropper ) feeding the box.

- term: MSPT
  aka:
    - Milliseconds Per Tick
    - ms
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A measurement of how many milliseconds it takes to process each @[gametick].
    If a server exceeds 50MSPT in total, then the game will slow down, as there
    is no longer enough time to process all 20 @[ticks per second](tps).
    MSPT is also used as a measure of how performance-intensive a contraption
    is by seeing how much the MSPT increases by running/loading it.

- term: Multi Item Sorter
  aka:
    - MIS
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A type of item sorter (system) that sorts multiple item-types into a single
    chest or group of chests, usually used to reduce space used by single
    item-type sorters to group not too common items into categories.

    - Concept
  description: >-
    An extension of @[n-Wide tileable], but where a solution has been provided
    by the author on how to put 2 @[Slices](Slice) of the same system next to
    each other, by moving/editing some components within the system. The capital
    letters ( AB, or ABC, or ABCD, ... ) annotate how the slices are tiled, and
    how many versions of the slice exist to achieve a result.

- term: n-Wide tileable
  aka:
    - '1wt, 2wt, ...'
    - nwt
  tags:
    - Feature
    - Concept
  description: >-
    Annotates the width of a slice, and whether or not you can build them right
    next to each other. There are systems that are 1 wide, but you can't put 2
    next to each other due to @[Crosstalk], so they don't get this annotation.
    Sometimes they are @[n-Wide AB Tileable] instead.

- term: Pair Searcher
  aka:
    - Pair Finder
    - Pair Assembler
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A pair searcher is a contraption that takes in multiple boxes (usually
    single item-type boxes) and outputs pairs of boxes so that the boxes of each
    pair have the same item type. They differ in speed, how they handle single
    boxes (ones that don't have a matching pair) and implementation in general.

- term: Parallel codes
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A code is said to be parallel if the all the bits of the signal are sent
    through individual wires or lines This usually allows for faster and easier
    to use codes than @[Serial codes], but it tends to be more expensive and
    bigger.

- term: Perfect aligner
  aka:
    - 4D aligner
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    Perfect item aligner refers to a contraption that aligns items in all three
    axes before sending them down a stream, where they usually get picked up by
    hoppers. Since these contraptions are usually ran at @[Hopper speed],  the
    items need to have a perfect timing between them, so that they don't reach a
    hopper during its cooldown stage, hence why these are also called 4D
    aligners (3D+time). 

- term: Peripheral

    Term used to describe contraptions that are almost Storage Tech. Examples
    are Furnace Arrays, Brewers, Crafting stations, Autocrafters, ...

- term: Pistonless
  tags:
    - Feature
    - Good Practice
  description: >-
    A contraption that makes no use of pistons. This is to reduce @[client-side
    lag](fps) due to tile entities in 1.16+ and general server-side lag, since each
    piston has to check all the @[Tile Entities](Tile Entity) in the world each
    time it tries to extend, and storage systems tend to have a lot of TEs. This
    effect is partly mitigated in 1.17+ and greatly mitigated by the Lithium mod.

- term: Precision Hopper
  tags:
    - Feature
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A hopper that is unlocked in the same tick as it's supposed to suck up an
    item. If the item entity is created in that tick, as it would be with for
    example timing a shulker box breaking correctly, there will be 0 physics
    enacted on that item. This makes it not only extremely reliable as there are
    no physics issues, but also might be lazy chunk compatible [Needs proof] .

- term: Precision Loader
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A @[Loader] that makes use of a @[Precision Hopper] to achieve @[Slice
    Preservation]

- term: Quasi connectivity
  aka:
    - QC
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    The effect of quasi-powering a piston, dropper or dispenser. A good way to
    visualize when a block is being quasi-powering is to imagine a redstone lamp
    above the component. If that lamp was to be on in that location, the block
    is quasi-powered. Quasi-powering usually doesn't update the component being
    QCed, which results in the component not "realizing" it should activate or
    deactivate until it receives an update. For this reason, QC is often  used
    for @[Block Update Detector], and people even sometimes say "BUD powered"
    rather than "quasi powered".

- term: Serial codes
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A code is said to be serial if the bits of the signal are sent one after the

    @[Parallel codes], but usually slower and harder to implement.

- term: Serializer/Deserializer
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    Components used to convert @[Serial codes] into @[Parallel codes] or
    viceversa. These sometimes also act as @[Encoders](Encoder) or
    @[Decoders](Decoder), in the computational redstone sense. For example
    serial hex to parallel binary is a deserializer encoder.

- term: Signal Strength 2 Filter
  aka:
    - SS2 filter
  tags:
    - StorageTech Concept
    - Feature
    - Bad Practice
  description: >-
    An item filter that relies on powering just two pieces of redstone dust
    before letting items flow through, which means that each filter has more
    room to pick up bigger batches of items as the idle state of the filter
    will have a lower item count. Tiling two identical SS2 filters next to each
    other can cause @[crosstalk] if one of the slots of the hopper fill up
    completely. This would cause the adjacent filter to break, and is therefore
    considered bad practice, unless mitigated by using signal strength isolated 
    filters that have been @[AB-tiled](n-wide AB tileable).

- term: Signal Strength 3 Filter
  aka:
    - SS3 filter
  tags:
    - StorageTech Concept
    - Feature
  description: >-
    An item filter that works by powering 3 pieces of redstone dust before
    letting items flow. Unlike @[SS2] filters, SS3 filters can be
    @[tiled](n-Wide tileable) without @[alternating slices](n-Wide AB-tileable)
    and still be overflow-proof.

- term: Silent
  tags:
    - Feature
  description: >-
    A contraption that does not make noise when activated. Sources of noise are:
    pistons, uncovered note blocks, trapdoors, doors and fence gates, and
    droppers or dispensers failing to fire. Silent contraptions usually avoid
    all of those.

  description: >-
    A contraption is said to be slice preserving if it outputs the shulker boxes
    or items within the slice, in contrast to @[Global Output], where there's
    one output for all @[Slices](Slice). This term is mostly used for @[1-Wide
    Tileable](N-Wide Tileable) contraptions. Since some systems are only mostly
    slice preserving, but fail to be so in some specific condition or with a
    very low change, some people use the term perfect slice preservation for a
    system that does not have said flaws.

  description: >-
    A contraption that has no moving parts or, more loosely, that has no pistons
    spitting blocks, or other forms of @[Toggle state]. This term is also
    sometimes interchangeably used with @[Pistonless], although you can have a

    Usually used when referring to pointing Comparators in
    @[Dropperlines](Dropperline) into repeaters/comparators increase the
    priority of the comparator and allow it to actually notice that an item is
    coming through

- term: Togglestate
  aka:
    - Toggle state

    - Concept
  description: >-
    Usually used to refer to intentionally having sticky piston's drop its block
    by sending it a <3gt pulse in order to cycle between two different states
    (toggling between block in and out).

    Importantly, togglestates have no default position, and there is no way to
    reset them. This makes them painful to use in survival as they're hard to
    debug.

    This is different to latches, which are also systems that hold state.
    Latches usually have a reset signal that you can trigger when something goes
    wrong.

- term: TPS
  aka:
    - Ticks per second
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    A measurement of how many @[gametick]s are happening each second. The game
    normally operates at 20TPS, but if @[MSPT] exceeds 50ms then the game will
    start to slow down. Mods such as Carpet Mod are able to stop, slow down, 
    or speed up the tick speed of a server, which can be useful for testing.

- term: Transcoder
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A device or contraption to convert between encodings of a signal: @[Binary]
    to @[Hexadecimal], hex to octal, pulse length to binary, block event delay
    to overloaded comparator, etc.

- term: Unstackable filter
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    A system to filter out unstackable items from a stream of stackable items.
    Usually done by reading the signal strength the item produces when in a
    container.

- term: Unstackable sorter
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    An item sorter that sorts unstackable items into different categories.
    Regular item sorters can not be used for this use case, because the items
    don't stack, so unique behaviors of each item type have to be used in order
    to separate them. Not to be confused with @[Unstackable filter] 

- term: User interface
  aka:
    - UI
  tags:
    - Concept
  description: >-
    User interface. The part of a contraption or system that the end user
    interacts with, regardless of the inner workings of the system.

- term: Variable sorter
  tags:
    - StorageTech Contraption
  description: >-
    An item filter that does not always filter for the same item, but instead
    can be remapped,  meaning getting the item type reassigned (in contrast with
    @[Fixed Sorter]). There are many different types of variable sorters: *
    Timer-based variable sorters unmap when a timer runs out. * Self-resetting
    variable sorters try to unmap constantly but fail if more items come in of
    the same type. * Globally-Triggered variable sorters unmap when receiving a
    signal from a global trigger
